      "solutionDetail": "When a particle moves with uniform velocity, it means both magnitude (speed) and direction remain constant. Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and velocity is not changing, acceleration must be zero.",
      "solutionSteps": [
         "Uniform velocity means constant speed and direction",
         "Acceleration = rate of change of velocity",
         "If velocity is constant, change in velocity = 0",
         "Therefore, acceleration = 0"
