Core 3D Visualization: Vedo or PyVista
For realistic, topic-based visualizations, especially in medical or scientific fields, you need powerful 3D rendering capabilities.
Vedo: This library is highly recommended for medical imaging and 3D data visualization because it is user-friendly and simplifies the complex Visualization Toolkit (VTK) backend. It can handle standard medical file formats like NIFTI and STL, making it excellent for showcasing anatomical structures or surgical simulations.
PyVista: Also based on VTK, PyVista provides a more "Pythonic" interface and is widely used across science and engineering for 3D data processing and visualization. It is a strong alternative offering broad applicability. 
2. Web Integration & User Interface: Dash (with Plotly) or Streamlit
Since you want a "platform," you will need to serve these visualizations via a web interface to make it accessible to users without them having to run Python code locally.
Dash: Built by Plotly, Dash is a powerful framework for building interactive analytical web applications using pure Python. It integrates seamlessly with Plotly's interactive 3D charts and is ideal for creating complex, highly customized dashboards.
Streamlit: A more beginner-friendly option that allows you to quickly turn Python scripts into shareable web apps. It's excellent for rapid prototyping and simpler single-page applications, though it offers less customization than Dash for complex UI layouts. 
3. General 2D & Interactive Plotting: Plotly
For general data analysis, interactive graphs, charts, and supplemental 2D visualizations (e.g., performance metrics, data distributions), the main Plotly library is superb for creating dynamic, web-based graphs that users can pan, zoom, and interact with. 
Summary of Recommended Stack
Layer 	Library(ies)	Purpose
3D Simulation	Vedo or PyVista	Handles the core scientific/medical 3D visualizations and simulations.
Web Platform	Dash (or Streamlit)	Hosts the application online and manages the user interface and interactivity.
2D/Data Visuals	Plotly	Creates interactive charts and graphs for data presentation within the platform.
By combining a specialized 3D visualization library with a web application framework, you can create a highly visual, interactive, and accessible NEET learning platform entirely within the Python ecosystem.
