2. Syllabus Content Source

The application content must be based on the official NEET (UG) 2025 Syllabus, which covers topics from Class 11 and Class 12.

2.1. Core Content (NCERT-based)

•
Physics: Units 1-20 (as per the PDF content)

•
Chemistry: Units 1-20 (as per the PDF content)

•
Biology (Botany & Zoology): Units 1-20 (as per the PDF content)

2.2. Extended Content (Reference Books)

To ensure 100% readiness, the app will include content and advanced practice questions from highly recommended reference books:

•
Physics: Concepts of Physics by H.C. Verma (Vol 1 & 2), Objective Physics by D.C. Pandey.

•
Chemistry: Physical Chemistry by O.P. Tandon, Organic Chemistry by O.P. Tandon/Morrison & Boyd, Inorganic Chemistry by J.D. Lee.

•
Biology: Trueman's Elementary Biology (Vol 1 & 2), Objective Biology by Dinesh.

3. Application Features (Confirmed by User)

The application must include all the following features:

1.
Interactive Practice Questions: With detailed solutions and explanations.

2.
Mock Tests: Simulating actual NEET exam conditions.

3.
Video Lectures/Concept Explanations: For all topics.

4.
Progress Tracking: Detailed performance analytics.

5.
Adaptive Learning: AI-based personalized study plans.

6.
Gamification: Points, badges, and leaderboards.

7.
Multi-Platform: Desktop, Mobile, and Web.

4. Assessment System Requirements

•
Chapter-wise Tests: For every unit/chapter in the syllabus.

•
Full-length Mock Tests: Simulating the 200-question, 720-mark pattern.

•
Previous Year Question Papers (PYQs): At least the last 10 years (2016-2025) to cover trends and pattern changes.

•
Daily Practice Questions (DPQs): Short, focused daily quizzes.

5. Technology Stack Consideration (Initial Draft for Phase 3)

•
Backend: Python (for AI/Adaptive Learning, API)

•
Frontend: C++ (for high-performance desktop/mobile components, if needed, but a modern cross-platform framework is preferred for multi-platform support) and a web framework (e.g., React/Vue)

•
Database: PostgreSQL (for scalability and complex data structures)

•
Interactive Elements: Python Turtle (as requested by the user, likely for simple, engaging physics/biology simulations or gamified elements). This will be integrated into the desktop/web environment.
