The LMS must be highly personalized and AI-driven:

Feature Category Detailed Requirements AI-Powered Personalization Adaptive Learning Paths: AI must analyze student performance, learning style, and pace to dynamically generate personalized course sequences and recommend supplementary modules. Course Creation & Content A robust Content Management System (CMS) supporting multimedia content (video, interactive text, quizzes, code snippets). The curriculum must be structured from "AI basics" (e.g., what is a neural network) to "fully building AI projects" (e.g., a simple image classifier). Assessment & Feedback Dynamic Assessments: Real-time, AI-graded quizzes and coding challenges. Gradebooks and Progress Tracking: Comprehensive dashboards for students, parents, and mentors to monitor individual progress, completion rates, and performance metrics. Communication & Collaboration Built-in features for activity feeds, discussion boards, and group workspaces to foster a collaborative learning environment among students.

3.2. Experiential Learning Platform (ELP)

This is the core differentiator, providing a practical, hands-on environment:

Feature Category Detailed Requirements Integrated Development Environment (IDE) A cloud-based, in-browser coding sandbox that supports Python and essential AI/ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn). This environment must be instantly accessible and require zero local setup. Simulations & Projects AI-Enhanced Simulations: Interactive, realistic scenarios for practicing AI concepts. Real-World Projects: A library of guided projects where students build, train, and deploy simple AI/ML models. Resource Management Secure, isolated environments for each student. The system must manage and allocate computational resources, including optional access to virtual GPU instances for model training, to ensure a smooth, practical experience.

3.3. Mentor Management System (MMS)

The MMS is critical for providing personalized human guidance:

Feature Category Detailed Requirements Mentor Registration & Vetting A secure, multi-step registration process for mentors, including mandatory background check integration (placeholder) and qualification verification by platform administrators. Smart Matching Algorithm An automated system to match students with the most suitable mentors based on student learning needs, mentor expertise, availability, and preferred communication style. Communication Tools Dedicated, secure in-platform chat and scheduling for video conferencing between mentors and mentees. Progress & Reporting Dashboards for mentors to track mentee progress, provide structured feedback on projects, and generate automated reports for parents/admins on the mentorship impact.

Advanced and Non-Functional Requirements
Requirement Type Feature/Specification Search Functionality Platform-wide Semantic Search: A powerful search engine that indexes all content types: course materials, code snippets, discussion forum posts, and mentor profiles. Search results must be contextually relevant and highly accurate. Gamification Implement a comprehensive gamification layer, including leaderboards, badges for course completion and project milestones, and a points/rewards system to drive student engagement and motivation. User Experience (UX) Mobile-First Design: The entire platform must be fully responsive and optimized for seamless use across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Security & Compliance Data Privacy: Strict adherence to K-12 data privacy regulations, including but not limited to COPPA, FERPA, and GDPR, to ensure the safety and privacy of student data. Technology Stack Must be modern, scalable, and secure. Recommended stack: React/Next.js (Frontend), Python/Django/FastAPI or Node.js/Express (Backend), PostgreSQL/MongoDB (Database).
